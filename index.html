                    In the Mahabharata it is said that Gandhari, the wife of Dretarastra, wanted
                    a son. Then he appealed to Byasa, a powerful hermit who still had kinship with the Kuru Dynasty. Finally, Gandhari's request was granted so that she became pregnant.

                    After going through a period of childbirth, what was born from her womb was only a lump of flesh. Vyasa then cut the meat into one hundred pieces and put it in a jar, which was then planted in the ground for a year. After a year, the jars were opened again and from within each urn, a baby boy emerged. The first to appear was Duryodhana, accompanied by Dursasana, and his other brothers.
